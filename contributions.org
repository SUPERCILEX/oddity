* Contributions
** The visualization itself
- "Inboxes"
- Unified display of messages and timestamps
- Logged state updates
- Branching events and tree-based navigation
** The debugger
- API for nodes to connect to the debug server
- Canonical event-handler abstraction
- Time-travel debugging of real systems--resetting and log replay
** (Potential) case studies
- Is the visualization useful for exploring models?
- Is the debugger useful for class projects?
- Is writing event-handler-based systems good?
